# SecurMask: Fortifying Data Privacy With Intelligent Masking

**SecurMask** is a web application designed to securely mask sensitive data in .csv and .xlsx files. With a sleek React frontend and a dual backend powered by both Node.js and Flask, the app ensures a seamless and secure data masking experience.

## Features

- **Data Masking**: Encrypt sensitive data in specified columns of CSV or XLSX files.
- **Data Unmasking**: Decrypt previously masked data to its original state.
- **Secure Encryption**: Utilizes the `cryptography` library for robust data encryption.
- Upload .csv and .xlsx files for secure processing.
- Mask sensitive data such as birthdates, addresses, emails, credit card details, and more.
- Customizable masking options: select specific columns or apply masking to all columns.
- Fast and secure processing with Pythonâ€™s Pandas and Node.js libraries.
- Responsive and user-friendly UI.
- Download the masked file securely.

## Technologies Used

**Frontend**

- **React.js**: Dynamic user interface.
- **SweetAlert2**: Elegant alert modals for user interactions.
- **CSS**: Custom styling and animations.
  
**Backend**

- **Node.js**: For file handling, routing, and integration with React.
- **Express.js**: API routing and server setup.
- **Flask**: Python-based backend for advanced data masking and processing.
- **Pandas**: Efficient data handling and transformation.
- **Python Faker**: Generating fake data for sensitive fields.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following tools are installed:

- **Node.js 14.x or later** (for the frontend and Node.js backend)
- **Python 3.8 or later** (for the Flask backend)
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **npm** or **yarn**

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ird1natris/SecurMask.git
   cd SecurMask
   ```
2. **Set Up the Backend**
   
   Navigate to the `backend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
   
   Install the required Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   
   Run the Flask backend:
   ```bash
   python app.py  
   ```

3. **Set Up the Frontend**

   Navigate to the `frontend` folder:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

   Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install  
   ```

   Start the React development server:
   ```bash
   npm start    
   ```
  
4. **Access the Application**

- **Frontend**: http://localhost:3000
- **Node.js API**: http://localhost:5000
- **Flask API**: http://localhost:5001

## Usage

1. **Upload File**: Click "Choose File" to upload a .csv or .xlsx file.
2. **Select Columns**: Pick specific columns to mask or select all columns.
3. **Mask Data**: Click "Mask Data" to process the file.
4. **Download**: Download the masked file once processing is complete.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement a unified backend API (Node.js + Flask integration).
- Expand support for other file formats (e.g., .json, .xml).
- Incorporate machine learning for intelligent data masking patterns.
